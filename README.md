# Cooperative Pathfinding (using A star algorithm)

## Introduction
* This simulation has been made using Unity
* It implements the ["Cooperative A Star Algorithm" as described by D. Silver](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Applications_files/coop-path-AIWisdom.pdf)
* The number of characters and the size of the planning window are configurable
* Each character randomly choose a destination and try to reach it avoiding the other ones
